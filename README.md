# DesignPatterns

Created a Desktop Application with GUI. Eight design patterns are used. 
These are Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Command, Adapter, and Iterator. 

The project I made is similar to the MHRS system. MySQL database is used but I did not upload the database. 
If you want to run it you can contact with me.
